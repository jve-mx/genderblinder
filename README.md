# Gender Blinder

A browser extension to remove implicit gender from English language web pages.

## Known limitations

* Due to the ambiguous nature of language, removing gender from natural English cannot easily be done with 100% accuracy.
* There is not a one-to-one mapping between English pronouns of different genders, so swapping them is error-prone.
* Not all gender specific words are covered.
