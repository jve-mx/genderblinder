# Gender Blinder

A browser extension to remove implicit gender from English language web pages.

## Known limitations

* Due to the ambiguous nature of language, removing gender from natural English cannot easily be done with 100% accuracy.
* Making gender specific words non-gender-specific is a lossy operation; information about the genders of characters being described is lost. This can make text more ambiguous. 
* There is not a one-to-one mapping between English pronouns of different genders, so sometimes there are two possible substitutions i.e. "his" -> "her" OR "his" -> "hers".
* Not all gender specific words are covered.

## Install

* Chrome - https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gender-blinder/fchfnnmlenjoppfonlacepldllfaglmg
